Steps to run:
1) Navigate, in the terminal, to the directory where you downloaded this repo.

$> ```pip install flask```
3) Then, once that is done, run this command in your terminal to spin up the flask server:
$> ```python app.py```
4) If all went well, your terminal should say ```Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
