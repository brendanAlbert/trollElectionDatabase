Steps to run:
1) Navigate, in the terminal, to the directory where you downloaded this repo.
2) You will need flask installed, so run this command in your terminal:
$> ```pip3 install flask```
3) Then, once that is done, run this command in your terminal to spin up the flask server:
$> ```python3 server.py```
4) If all went well, your terminal should say ```Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
  Click on that link it provides or navigate to it in your browser.
